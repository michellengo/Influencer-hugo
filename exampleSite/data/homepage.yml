      * Direct instruction

      content : "School provides so much more for students than just academic instruction.  There is no reason that your child should lose out on social-emotional development, collaboration with peers or having a class buddy because in-person school is reduced to part-time. This is the best way to replicate a school environment in the safety of a space that you control. In a small group of 3-4 children in the same grade, the teacher will provide direct, in-person instruction on virtual learning days. Virtual learning does not have to mean lonely learning! A small group of classmates allows your child to collaborate with peers, engage in meaningful dialogue and develop social-emotional skills. "

      content : "We hired Beck in February 2020 to work with my 5-year-old son, who was behind his peers in school with counting, letter recognition, and he occasionally didn't follow instructions or share with other children. Beck has been wonderful working with him. She doesn’t only focus on numbers and letters, but also focuses on my son as a whole person. He adores her! Beck talks about education and my son's development with more intelligence and detail than almost any teacher I have ever heard. I couldn't give Beck a higher recommendation - she is wonderful."

She supported him in both executive functioning skills like focusing and time management while also helping in an array of subjects like math, writing, and Spanish. My son felt respected and understood when he was working with Beck."
